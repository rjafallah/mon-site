            Language learning has been a key part of my growth. Alongside my native Arabic, I’ve learned French, the language of education in Morocco, 
            and reached a B2 level in English for international communication. Recently, I began learning Spanish, 
            inspired by my love for its culture and cuisine. Each language enriches my connection to diverse cultures.

                <p class="langue1"> 
                    Arabic is my native language, and it is both a rich and challenging language. 
                    Its complexity lies in its vast vocabulary, intricate grammatical structures, 
                    and unique sounds that can be difficult for non-native speakers to master. 
                    Arabic also has a deep cultural and historical significance, being the language of literature, science, and religion for centuries. 
                    The variety of dialects spoken across different regions adds another layer of richness, making it a versatile and expressive language.

                <p class="langue1">
                    English is my third language, and I currently have a B2 level proficiency. 
                    Learning English has been both rewarding and challenging, as it plays a crucial role in academia, technology, 
                    and international communication. Although it was not easy to master certain aspects like pronunciation and idiomatic expressions, 
                    I have developed solid reading, writing, speaking, and listening skills. This level allows me to communicate effectively in most situations, 
                    participate in discussions, and understand complex texts, though I continue to work on improving my fluency and vocabulary.

                <h2> French </h2>
                <p class="langue2"> 
                    French is a language I have spoken since childhood, as it plays a key role in the educational system in Morocco. 
                    From a young age, I have been exposed to French both in school and in daily life, 
                    which has allowed me to develop strong communication skills in the language. In Morocco, French is widely used in education, 
                    especially in subjects like science, mathematics, and physics, making it essential for academic success. 
                    This early and consistent exposure has given me a solid foundation in both formal and informal French, 
                    though I continue to work on refining my fluency.

                <p class="langue2"> 
                    I am currently learning Spanish, driven by my love for Spanish culture and cuisine. 
                    The rich traditions, vibrant music, and warm lifestyle of Spain have always fascinated me. 
                    Additionally, I enjoy exploring Spanish dishes like paella and churros... which adds to my motivation. 
                    Learning the language allows me to connect more deeply with these cultural aspects and engage with native speakers. 
                    Although it can be challenging, I find the process rewarding and exciting, as it opens the door to new experiences and friendships.
